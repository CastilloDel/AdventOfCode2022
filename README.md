## Solutions to Advent Of Code 2022
### Daniel del Castillo de la Rosa

This year I decided to participate in the Advent Of Code in Go.
All the solutions can be found in their respective directory and in one file. Solutions assume knowledge about the problem itself, you can check the problems in the [Advent Of Code page](https://adventofcode.com). Remember this repository is for the 2022 edition!


I could't finish all the challenges because the assignments from uni got too demanding, but I had a blast!
